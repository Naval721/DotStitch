# 🎁 Free Trial Export Limit Guide

## Overview

Free trial users (users with 5 points from signup) are limited to **5 exports only**. After that, they need to buy points to continue exporting.

## 🎯 Export Limits

### Free Trial Users (5 points):
- ✅ **5 exports maximum**
- ✅ Can export individual designs
- ✅ Can export up to 5 designs at once
- ❌ Cannot exceed 5 total exports
- ❌ Must buy points to continue

### Paid Users (Purchased points):
- ✅ **Unlimited exports** (based on points)
- ✅ Can export any number of designs
- ✅ Points deducted per export
- ✅ No export limit

## 📊 How It Works

### Export Current Design:
```
1. User clicks "Export Current"
2. System checks:
   - Is user logged in? ✅
   - Does user have enough points? ✅
   - Is user on free trial? Check export count
   - Has user used 5 exports? ❌ → Show error
3. If OK → Export design
4. Deduct 1 point
5. Increment free export count
```

### Export All Designs:
```
1. User clicks "Export All"
2. System checks:
   - Is user logged in? ✅
   - Does user have enough points? ✅
   - Is user on free trial? Check export count
   - Will this exceed 5 exports? ❌ → Show error
3. If OK → Export all designs
4. Deduct points for each design
5. Increment free export count
```

## 🎨 UI Indicators

### Free Trial Banner:
```
"Free Trial: 3/5 exports used"
```

### Error Messages:
```
❌ "You've reached your free trial limit of 5 exports. Please buy points to continue!"
❌ "Free trial users can export maximum 5 designs at once."
❌ "Free trial limit reached! You can only export 2 more design(s)."
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Export Count Tracking:
```typescript
const [freeExportCount, setFreeExportCount] = useState(0);

// Check if user is on free trial
const isFreeUser = currentPoints === 5 && profile?.total_points_purchased === 5;

// Check export limit
if (isFreeUser && freeExportCount >= 5) {
  toast.error("You've reached your free trial limit!");
  return;
}

// Increment after export
setFreeExportCount(prev => prev + 1);
```

### Points Deduction:
```typescript
// Deduct 1 point per export
await deductPoints(1, `Exported ${playerName} jersey`);
```
