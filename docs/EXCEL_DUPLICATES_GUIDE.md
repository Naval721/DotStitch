## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use Custom Tags
Add tags to distinguish duplicates:
```
Captain, Backup, Extra 1, Extra 2, etc.
```

### 2. Consistent Formatting
Keep data format consistent:
```
Player Name: "John Doe" (not "john doe" or "John doe")
```

### 3. Clear Team Names
Use clear team identifiers:
```
Team Name: "Falcons Home", "Falcons Away", etc.
```

### 4. Size Variations
Use size column for different jersey sizes:
```
Size: 24, 26, 28 for same player
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
