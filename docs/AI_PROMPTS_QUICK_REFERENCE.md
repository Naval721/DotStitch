## üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Always include:**
   - Exact dimensions (e.g., "1920x1080px")
   - "white background" or "transparent background"
   - "professional photography" or "product photography"
   - "high quality" or "high resolution"

2. **For consistency:**
   - Use similar color schemes across related images
   - Maintain the same style (realistic vs. illustrated)
   - Keep backgrounds consistent (white for all)

3. **If results aren't perfect:**
   - Regenerate multiple times
   - Adjust specific details (colors, style, angle)
   - Use variations: "more vibrant", "softer lighting", etc.
