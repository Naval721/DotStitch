## 🎯 Priority Order

Generate images in this order:

1. **Hero image** (most visible, 5 minutes)
2. **Homepage features** (3 images, 10 minutes)
3. **Gallery** (6 images, 20 minutes)
4. **Size templates** (optional, 24 images, 1 hour)

**Minimum viable:** Just do hero + homepage features = 15 minutes!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Always include:**
   - Exact dimensions (e.g., "1920x1080px")
   - "white background"

2. **For consistency:**
   - Use similar color schemes
